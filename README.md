Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

           - Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that specializes in individulized finacial plans for their clients. They had us create a public web aplication and make sure it is secure to hold sensitive finacial information.
           
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

            - I would say it took me some time o figure this project out but I did well at catching alll the current vulnerabilities throughout the code to make sure the integrity and realiablity of the company was protected.
            
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

                         - I really appreciated using the dependency check tool because it save quite abit of time detecting all vulnerabilities instead of me having to do it manually.
                         
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
                                        - Implementing security controls because interanl controls are technical safgaurds put in place to prevent problems and protects the companys assets.
                            - 
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
                                        - Well to make sure the code and software was functional I had to re reun the deendency check to see if any new aere added and I maually did a code review.
                             -     
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

               -I used YouTube and I also asked a computer science forumw while making sure readability since thats the most crucial aspect of great programming.
